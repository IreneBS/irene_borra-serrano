First experience mentoring a PhD student. Improving my assertive communication.

<p style = "text-align: justify; font-size: 10 pt">
The thesis has an agronomic and technological focus, and is therefore multidisciplinary. 
It requires knowledge in ecology, habitat management and biodiversity for the study of flora, in remote sensing and sensors for image acquisition and processing, in artificial intelligence for object detection and classification and image analysis, and in statistics for data interpretation.
Two directors with complementary specialities and experiences are involved for the supervision of the PhD student, in order to cover the necessary technical and theoretical knowledge and to foster his professional development. 
The combination of these specialisations will broaden the opportunities for contact and collaboration by belonging to different networks and research fields.
