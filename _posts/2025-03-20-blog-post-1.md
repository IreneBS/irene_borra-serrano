- I love basketball. I play and I watch matches every week. It is my way to empty my mind after work.
- I am from Córdoba and you can hear it when I talk.
- I lived in Belgium for seven years and got rained on more than most Spanish in a lifetime. 
- I used to bike to go to work now I am scared to do it in Madrid.
- I tried crossfit once. Never again. Don't ask me why.
- I love annoying cats and I don't get why they don't like it when I do that.
- I have more books than space to put them and time to read them.
