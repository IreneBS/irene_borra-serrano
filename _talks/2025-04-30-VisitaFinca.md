Students from FP Agraria - IES Centro de Capacitaci√≥n Agraria came to visit us. Researchers from different departments and groups explained their research. 
Various topics such as Carbon sequestration, soil health or biodiversity were covered. 

The Sustainable Agricuture and Climate Change trial (SACC) aims to identify which sustainable agricultural practices minimise the impacts of climate change on crop production, carbon sequestration and soil health. The project is funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (Ref PID2020-113021RA-I00).
