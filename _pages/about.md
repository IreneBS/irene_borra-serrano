First draft of my portfolio to test the posibilities of github pages. Under construction.

I am a forestry engineer with a specialization (M.Sc) in remote sensing applied to forest management. I obtained my PhD (Bioscience Engineering, KU Leuven, Belgium) in November 2020.<br>From January 2023 to December 2024, I worked as Juan de la Cierva post-doctoral researcher at the Institute of Agricultural Sciences (ICA-CSIC) in the Geospatial and Precision Technologies for Sustainable Agriculture group (Tech4Agro) within the plant protection department. I am currently working in the project ECODigital at the same institution.<br>My main research line is to develop technical solutions to support management decisions related to crop status and varieties in breeding programs and agricultural fields based on remote sensing data and open-source tools.

Project summary --> ECODigital proposes the application of technologies in the fields of remote sensing, sensorisation, artificial intelligence (AI), image analysis algorithms and computer vision for the development and validation of digital tools for agriculture. Digital technology will be used through ground and remote sensing (drone) to monitor crops and their habitat. The entire digitisation workflow will be covered, mainly through low-cost hardware and open source, free and accessible software.<br>ECODigital will be implemented in different plots of the experimental farm La Poveda (managed by ICA-CSIC), through three pilot scenarios covering a wide range of agroecosystems: maize, vineyard and floral margins. In addition to promoting the use of technologies in the agricultural sector, this proposal aims to enhance the resources of the La Poveda estate and the ICA as reference centres for R&D in the digitisation of agriculture. Website TBA.
