Work in progress.  
During the ECODigital project I am going to improve my coding skills, so keep an eye on my github profile ! ;)  
This first approach to Github pages and my portfolio was a fun learning process. I learned a bit more about Markdown and html sintax and files. 


{% include base_path %}


{% for post in site.portfolio %}
  {% include archive-single.html %}
