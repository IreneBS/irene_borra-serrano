Introduction: Growing grass-legume mixtures for forage production improves both yield productivity and nutritional quality, while also benefiting the environment by promoting species biodiversity and enhancing soil fertility (through nitrogen fixation). Consequently, assessing legume proportions in grass-legume mixed swards is essential for breeding and cultivation. This study introduces an approach for automated classification and mapping of species in mixed grass-clover swards using object-based image analysis (OBIA).

Methods: The OBIA procedure was established for both RGB and ten band multispectral (MS) images capturedby an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The workflow integrated structural (canopy heights) and spectral variables (bands, vegetation indices) along with a machine learning algorithm (Random Forest) to perform image segmentation and classification. Spatial k-fold cross-validation was employed to assess accuracy.

Results and discussion: Results demonstrated good performance, achieving an overall accuracy of approximately 70%, for both RGB and MS-based imagery, with grass and clover classes yielding similar F1 scores, exceeding 0.7 values. The effectiveness of the OBIA procedure and classification was examined by analyzing correlations between predicted clover fractions and dry matter yield (DMY) proportions. This quantification revealed a positive and strong relationship, with R2 values exceeding 0.8 for RGB and MS-based classification outcomes. This indicates the potential of estimating (relative) clover coverage, which could assist breeders but also farmers in a precision agriculture context.
