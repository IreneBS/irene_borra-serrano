Atm private repository as it is not finished.

I am testing a couple of new tools and learning how to create a website from scratch. My previous experiences with websites were in Wordpress working with defined templates and only to insert content. I am having fun even if it is taking a bit of time to finish the website! 

As one of the main objectives of Momentum is to learn and broaden my programming skills, it is a great opportunity to invest time on this learning process.  Not only I use AI tools but also I ask around my human friends! 

Letâ€™s explain a bit more in detail the process to create the website. As first step I used ChatGPT to prepare the prompt for the lovable app. I gave indications of the sections that I want for the website and the documentation of the lovable app.  

In the lovable app, as the prompt was quite structured and complete, the resulting website was pretty close to the result I wanted. I added and changed a couple of things and the website was "ready" with the sections and pages that I need.  

The code was exported to GitHub as a repository and clone to work on it locally. Before any change was made it was important to understand all files and directories that were created 
in the lovable app. And do not touch the configuration files!  

To be able to visualize the website locally on my pc it was needed to install nvm to start the server with the command npm run dev. Not only for that feature but also to install all libraries needed for the website. The installation was not easy on my win2 pc but thanks to IT we succeeded!  

Something I learned is that the files .gitignore is quite crucial to indicate directories that we do not want to upload to github, e.g. libraries.  

First tests and changes done were in the News section as I plan to update that section regularly as the project progresses.  

Update - Section news under control, I am capable of adding as many as I want and even add pictures.  
Next To do's: change the picture of the main page and add the logo!
