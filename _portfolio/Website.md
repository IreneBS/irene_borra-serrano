Atm private repository as it is not finished.

I am testing a couple of new tools and learning how to create a website from scratch. My previous experiences with websites were in Wordpress working with defined templates and only to insert content. I am having fun even if it is taking a bit of time to finish the website! 

As one of the main objectives of Momentum is to learn and broaden my programming skills, it is a great opportunity to invest time on this learning process.  Not only I use AI tools but also I ask around my human friends!
